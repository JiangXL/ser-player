##SER Player
A simple video player for playing SER files used for solar, lunar and planetary astronomy-imaging.

SER Player is a C++ application using the Qt cross-platform framework so that it can be built for Windows, OS X and Linux.

###Project Goals
Some simple goals that hopefully get accross my intentions for this project.
* Produce a lightweight and intuative video player application for .ser files.
* Avoid feature creep and over complication in order to keep SER Player distinct from [PIPP](https://sites.google.com/site/astropipp/).  New features may be added if they are not duplicating PIPP's functionality.
* SER Player must remain cross-platform and support at least Windows, OS X and Linux.

##Building SER Player for Windows
This section has some basic notes on building the application for Windows.  These notes assume a Windows PC is being used to build the application.
* Install Qt v5.4.1 and Qt Creator
* Open Qt project file **ser-player\ser_player\ser_player.pro** with Qt Creator
* Select **Release** instead of **Debug**.
* Do **Build Menu->Run qmake** to run qmake.
* Do **Build Menu->Build All** to build the application.
* The directory **ser_player\bin\** will contain the application executable and many DLL files required for it to run.

With the application built we next need to build an installer.  This is done using the [NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download) Windows installer creation program.
* Download and install NSIS 2.46.
* Start NSIS and click on **Compile NSI scripts**.
* This will open a **MakeNSISW** window.
* Open file **ser-player\ser_player_nsis\ser_player.nsi** with the **MakeNSISW** window.  The simplest way is to drag the file and drop it in the window.
* This will run the NSIS installer creator and generate the installer file **ser-player\ser_player_nsis\ser_player_install.exe**

This installer file can now be distributed to other Windows users.


##Building SER Player for OS X
This section has some basic notes on building the application for OS X.  These notes assume a Mac running OS X is being used to build the application.
* Install Qt v5.4.1 and Qt Creator
* Open Qt project file **ser-player\ser_player\ser_player.pro** with Qt Creator
* Select **Release** instead of **Debug**.
* Do **Build Menu->Run qmake** to run qmake.
* Do **Build Menu->Build All** to build the application.
* This Apple disk image (.dmg) file **ser_player\bin\SER-Player.dmg** will created.

This disk image file contains the SER-Player application and can be distributed to other Mac users.


##Building SER Player for Debian Linux
###Building using the Terminal
This section has some basic notes on building the application for Debian Linux using the terminal.  These notes assume a PC running a varient of Debian Linux is being used to build the application.  The qtbase5-dev package must be installed.

* Terminal $ cd ser-player/ser_player
* Terminal $ qmake CONFIG+=release
* Terminal $ qmake DEFINES+=DISABLE_NEW_VERSION_CHECK CONFIG+=release
* Terminal $make
* The directory **ser_player/bin/** will contain the application executable only.

The next step to create a Debian binary package that can be shared with other users is a little 'hacky' but it works for now!

* Terminal $ cd ser-player/linux_release
* Terminal $ ./make_release_amd64.sh  (Or ./make_release_i386.sh for a 32-bit binary package.)
* A Debian binary package of the form **ser-player/linux_release/ser-player_X.X.X-1_amd64.deb** will be generated

This Debian binary package can now be distributed to other Debian linux users.


###Building Using Qt Creator
This section has some basic notes on building the application for Debian Linux using Qt Creator.  These notes assume a PC running a varient of Debian Linux is being used to build the application.
* Install Qt v5.4.1 and Qt Creator
* Open Qt project file **ser-player/ser_player/ser_player.pro** with Qt Creator
* Select **Release** instead of **Debug**.
* Do **Build Menu->Run qmake** to run qmake.
* Do **Build Menu->Build All** to build the application.
* The directory **ser_player/bin/** will contain the application executable only.

The next step to create a Debian binary package that can be shared with other users is a little 'hacky' but it works for now!
* Open a terminal window and **cd** to **ser-player/linux_release/**
* Run the **make_release_amd64.sh** script to create a 64-bit binary package ot run the **make_release_i386.sh** script to build the 32-bit binary package.
* A Debian binary package of the form **ser-player/linux_release/ser-player_X.X.X-1_amd64.deb** will be generated

This Debian binary package can now be distributed to other Debian linux users.
